After quality filtering and trimming reads produced in an RNA-seq experiment, we align these reads to a genome and alignment information is outputted in the form of SAM file. The SAM file in it's raw form however, will not be completely ready to use in downstream analyses due to the potential presence of PCR Duplicates within the file. PCR duplicates of RNA reads are an unwanted by-product of PCR library amplification, and if they are not removed from the SAM file they may be falsley over-represented during reference genome mapping. PCR duplicates can arise during library prep for various reasons but usually by chance, and for certain types of libraries and fragments this chance can increase. Recognizing which sequences are true duplicates is not as straight forwards as removing identical sequences, and there are specific SAM file indicators that we can look at and compare to determine true duplicates versus highly expressed genes.
